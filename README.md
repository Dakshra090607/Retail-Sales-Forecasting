# Retail-Sales-Forecasting
Decoupled Retail Sales Forecasting &amp; BI Platform. Uses Prophet (Python) for 365-day time series prediction ($\hat{y}$, $\hat{y}_{\text{lower/upper}}$). The model runs offline, persisting results to CSV. A high-performance Streamlit dashboard then visualizes KPIs, state-level EDA, and the full forecast with uncertainty bounds.
